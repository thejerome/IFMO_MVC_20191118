Hello, dear Efimchik
if you read this, this means i am totally driven insane by your favorite Java
This code is an abomination, based on at least 5 ideas of realisation, though,
as those are only ideas which were explained to me by different people screen-to-screen and stackoverflow,
they shouldn't  be considered as plagiate, mostly because they were transformed by creating this into
something much worse. That worse, than universe has ever needed
So please, consider this a resultative branch so as we both can end this suffering
